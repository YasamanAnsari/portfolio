	`I live and work in Tehran, Iran. My day job includes web development, working with different databases especially Oracle right now, bash scripting and etc.`,
	`My interest in machine learning lately has led me to try out some side projects and to hone my Python skills in order to cross the river of possibilities. Whenever I work on a project, I see it as a puzzle that has to be solved, which is what I enjoy the most. I view every problem as a learning opportunity. When I'm planning, I typically visualize an overall picture in my mind, then break it down into smaller steps; divide and conquer, as the saying goes.`,
	`Besides the cool-looking world of machine learning, what draws me to it is that I have always considered my audiences' needs carefully, and machine learning is a valuable tool for identifying and satisfying those needs.`,
	`Furthermore, I'm passionate about crypto and cooking as well.`,
